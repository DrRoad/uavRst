#### Example to use fa_basicTreeCrownFilterfor a common analysis of the
    estimated spreading distances of an specifified area

#
  trees_crowns <- fa_basicTreeCrownFilter(crownFn = paste0(pd_gi_run,"crownsHeight.shp"),segType = 1,
                                      minTreeAlt = 5, 
                                      crownMinArea = 3, 
                                      crownMaxArea = 300)
