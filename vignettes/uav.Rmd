This version of the document was produced on _`r format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %Y")`_ using `uavRst` version **`r packageVersion("uavRst")`**

------

# Installation
The `uavRst` package needs the `library("devtools")`:

```{r, eval = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=9.47}
devtools::install_github("gisma/uavRst")
```

# Some remarks about UAV flying 

The basic idea is to provide an easy to use workflow for controlling rtf UAVs from planning and flying autonoumous surveys up to the derivation and postclassification of the data. The focus is set on retrieving your own data for answering your own questions keeping in mind the specific advantages and disadvantages of UAV derived data. RTF UAV#s provide very high spatial and very low spectral resolutions. Additionally the point cloud is only genereated by visible surface structures. 



```{r}

```


# Some examples

First we need to load some packages and get data:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

Please note you have to activate the layers using the layer control in the upper right corner.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 

```

For the NASA EarthData you may use the visEarthPole() function.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

                  
```

------


# Final remarks

There are still a lot of limitations that need addressing:

In future releases I would like to 

* get around the issue that you have to do a manual job in parameter sampling
* integrate a defined plugin concept for own function that provides correct parameter lists
* integrate a fully working localTile functionality
* ...

I hope that you will find projvView as useful.
