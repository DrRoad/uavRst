Description: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing Tools. In general the unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing toolbox tries to support the use of drone derived imagery and point clouds as a cheap and easy to use alternative/complement to light detection and ranging data. It provides functionality to analyze poor quality digital aerial images as taken by low budget ready to fly drones. This includes pre-configured machine learning based classification functions, comprehensive texture analysis, segmentation algorithms as well as forest relevant analyzes of metrics and measures on the derived products.
